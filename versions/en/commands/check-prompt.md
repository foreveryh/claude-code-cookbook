## Check Prompt

A comprehensive best practices collection for evaluating and improving prompt quality for AI agents. This systematizes insights gained from actual prompt improvement processes, covering all critical aspects including ambiguity elimination, information consolidation, enforcement strengthening, tracking systems, and continuous improvement.

### Usage

```bash
# Check quality of a prompt file
cat your-prompt.md | /check-prompt "Check this prompt's quality and provide improvement suggestions"
```

### Options

- None: Analyze current file or selected text
- `--category <name>`: Check only specific category (structure/execution/restrictions/quality/roles/improvement)
- `--score`: Calculate quality score only
- `--fix`: Auto-suggest fixes for detected issues
- `--deep`: Deep analysis mode (focus on ambiguity, information dispersion, enforcement strength)

### Basic Examples

```bash
# Overall prompt quality evaluation
cat devin/playbooks/code-review.md | /check-prompt "Evaluate this prompt's quality across 6 categories and provide issues and improvement suggestions"

# Deep analysis mode
/check-prompt --deep "Focus on checking ambiguity, information dispersion, and insufficient enforcement for fundamental improvement suggestions"

# Check specific category
/check-prompt --category structure "Check this prompt from structure and clarity perspective"

# Detect and fix ambiguous expressions
/check-prompt --fix "Detect ambiguous expressions and suggest clear expression corrections"
```

## Core Design Principles

### Principle 1: Completely Eliminate Room for Interpretation

- **Absolutely Forbidden**: "in principle", "recommended", "if possible", "as appropriate", "judge accordingly"
- **Must Use**: "definitely", "absolutely", "strictly observe", "without exception", "mandatory"
- **Exception Conditions**: Strictly limited numerically ("only the following 3 conditions", "except these 2 cases")

### Principle 2: Strategic Information Integration

- Complete integration of related important information into one section
- Summarize overall picture in execution checklist
- Thoroughly eliminate reference cycles and dispersion

### Principle 3: Build Graduated Enforcement

- Clear hierarchy: üî¥ (execution halt level) ‚Üí üü° (quality important) ‚Üí üü¢ (recommendations)
- Gradual upgrade from recommendation level to mandatory level
- Clear indication of impact and response for violations

### Principle 4: Ensure Traceability

- All execution results recordable and verifiable
- Technical prevention of false reporting
- Objective criteria for success/failure judgment

### Principle 5: Feedback-Driven Improvement

- Learn from actual failure cases
- Continuous effectiveness verification
- Automatic detection of new patterns

## üö® Critical Problem Patterns (Immediate Fix Required)

### ‚ùå Level 1: Critical Ambiguity (Execution Halt Level)

- **Multiple-interpretation possible instructions**: "judge appropriately", "according to situation", "in principle"
- **Ambiguous exception conditions**: "in special cases", "when necessary"
- **Subjective judgment criteria**: "appropriately", "sufficiently", "as much as possible"
- **Undefined important concepts**: "standard", "general", "basic"

### ‚ùå Level 2: Structural Defects (Quality Important Level)

- **Information dispersion**: Important related information scattered in 3 or more locations
- **Circular references**: Section A‚ÜíB‚ÜíC‚ÜíA infinite loops
- **Contradictory instructions**: Conflicting instructions in different sections
- **Unclear execution order**: Procedures with unclear dependencies

### ‚ùå Level 3: Quality Degradation (Recommended Improvement Level)

- **Unverifiability**: Unclear success/failure judgment criteria
- **Automation difficulty**: Design dependent on human subjective judgment
- **Maintenance difficulty**: Structure where update impact range is unpredictable
- **Learning difficulty**: Complexity that takes time for newcomers to understand

## üéØ Proven Improvement Methods

### ‚úÖ Gradual Strengthening Approach

1. **Current Analysis**: Problem classification, prioritization, impact assessment
2. **Critical Problem Priority**: Complete resolution of Level 1 problems as top priority
3. **Gradual Implementation**: Implement in verifiable units, not all changes at once
4. **Effect Measurement**: Quantitative comparison before and after improvement
5. **Continuous Monitoring**: Confirm sustainability of improvement effects

### ‚úÖ Practical Ambiguity Elimination Methods

```markdown
# ‚ùå Before improvement (ambiguous)
"Issues should, in principle, be recorded as inline comments on the relevant changed locations on GitHub"

# ‚úÖ After improvement (clear)
"Issues must definitely be recorded as inline comments on the relevant changed locations on GitHub. Exceptions are only the 3 conditions defined in Section 3.3"
```

### ‚úÖ Practical Information Integration Methods

```markdown
# ‚ùå Before improvement (dispersed)
Section 2.1: "Use mandatory 6 sections"
Section 3.5: "üìä Overall evaluation, üìã Issues..."
Section 4.2: "Section deletion prohibited"

# ‚úÖ After improvement (integrated)
Execution Checklist:
‚ñ° 10. Post summary comment (use mandatory 6 sections)

üî¥ Mandatory 6 sections:
1) üìä Overall evaluation
2) üìã Issue classification summary
3) ‚ö†Ô∏è Major concerns
4) ‚úÖ Commendable points
5) üéØ Conclusion
6) ü§ñ AI review quality self-assessment

‚ùå Absolutely prohibited: Section deletion, addition, name changes
```

### ‚úÖ Tracking System Implementation Patterns

```bash
# Strict tracking of execution results
POSTED_COMMENTS=0
FAILED_COMMENTS=0
TOTAL_COMMENTS=0

# Record results of each operation
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "‚úÖ Success: $OPERATION" >> /tmp/execution_log.txt
    POSTED_COMMENTS=$((POSTED_COMMENTS + 1))
else
    echo "‚ùå Failed: $OPERATION" >> /tmp/execution_log.txt
    FAILED_COMMENTS=$((FAILED_COMMENTS + 1))
fi

# Prevent false reporting
if [ $POSTED_COMMENTS -ne $REPORTED_COMMENTS ]; then
    echo "üö® Warning: Reported count doesn't match actual posts"
    exit 1
fi
```

## üìà Quality Score Calculation (Improved Version)

### Overall Score Calculation

```
Basic score = Œ£(Each category score √ó points) / 100

Critical problem penalties:
- Level 1 problems: -20 points/case
- Level 2 problems: -10 points/case  
- Level 3 problems: -5 points/case

Bonus elements:
- Automation support: +5 points
- Learning function implementation: +5 points
- Proven improvement cases: +5 points

Final score = Basic score + Bonus - Penalties
```

### Quality Level Determination

```
95-100 points: World-class standard (recommendable as industry standard)
90-94 points: Excellent (production-ready)
80-89 points: Good (operational with minor improvements)
70-79 points: Average (improvements needed)
60-69 points: Needs improvement (major modifications required)
50-59 points: Major revision needed (fundamental review required)
49 points or below: Usage prohibited (complete redesign required)
```

### Lessons and Best Practices

#### Success Factors

1. **Gradual approach**: Implement in verifiable units, not all changes at once
2. **Data-driven**: Improvements based on measured data, not subjective judgment
3. **Continuous monitoring**: Regular confirmation of improvement effect sustainability
4. **Feedback emphasis**: Actively collect opinions from actual users

#### Failure Avoidance Strategies

1. **Excessive perfectionism**: Start operation at 90 points, aim for 100 through continuous improvement
2. **Danger of bulk changes**: Definitely implement large-scale changes gradually
3. **Backward compatibility**: Minimize impact on existing workflows
4. **Insufficient documentation**: Record and share all changes in detail

### Integration with Claude

```bash
# Quality check combined with prompt file
cat your-prompt.md | /check-prompt "Evaluate this prompt's quality and suggest improvements"

# Comparison of multiple prompt files
cat prompt-v1.md && echo "---" && cat prompt-v2.md | /check-prompt "Compare these two versions and analyze improved points and remaining issues"

# Analysis combined with actual error logs
cat execution-errors.log | /check-prompt --deep "Identify prompt issues that may have caused these errors"
```

### Notes

- **Prerequisites**: Prompt files recommended to be written in Markdown format
- **Limitations**: For large prompts (10,000+ lines), recommend splitting for analysis
- **Recommendations**: Regularly perform prompt quality checks and continuously improve
