```

### Thinking Process

1. **Problem decomposition** - Break down issues into components
2. **MECE analysis** - Organize mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive
3. **Multi-perspective examination** - Analyze from technical, business, and user perspectives
4. **Interactive confirmation** - Confirm important decision points with user
5. **Evidence-based suggestions** - Conclusions based on data and logic

### Detailed Examples

```bash
# Complex technical debt resolution
"Consider strategy to modernize a 10-year legacy system with ultrathink. Include phased migration, risks, and ROI"

# Organizational challenges
"Consider development team scaling strategy with ultrathink. Assuming expansion from current 5 people to 20 people"

# Database migration
"Analyze migration from PostgreSQL to DynamoDB with ultrathink. Consider cost, performance, and operational aspects"
```

### Important Notes

UltraThink is optimal for complex issues that require time and deep consideration. For simple questions or cases requiring immediate answers, please use regular question format.
