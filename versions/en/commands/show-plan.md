## Show Plan

Display current implementation plan.

### Usage

```bash
/show-plan
```

### Basic Examples

```bash
# Check current plan
/show-plan
"Display the running plan"

# When no plan exists
/show-plan
"No plan in current session"
```

### Features

- Detect plans created by exit_plan_mode
- Search for headings containing keywords like implementation plan, implementation content, plan
- Format and display plan content
- Clearly notify when no plan exists

### Claude Integration

```bash
# Check plan during implementation
"What was I implementing?"
/show-plan

# Multiple tasks running
"Let me check the current plan again"
/show-plan

# Review after plan execution
"Show me the plan content from earlier"
/show-plan
```

### Detection Patterns

Based on the plan format generated by exit_plan_mode, detects the following patterns:

- Headings starting with `##` (containing plan, Plan)
- `### Change Content`
- `### Implementation Content`
- `### Implementation Plan`
- Numbered headings like `### 1.`

### Important Notes

- Display only plans within current session (excludes past sessions)
- Prioritize displaying the latest plan
