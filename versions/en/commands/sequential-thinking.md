## Sequential Thinking

Apply step-by-step analytical thinking process for complex problems and systematic solution development.

### Usage

```bash
# Request Claude sequential thinking
"Consider [issue] with sequential-thinking"
```

### Basic Examples

```bash
# Algorithm design
"Design an efficient caching strategy with sequential-thinking"

# Problem solving
"Solve database performance issues with sequential-thinking"

# Design consideration
"Consider real-time notification system design with sequential-thinking"
```

### Claude Integration

```bash
# Complex implementation approach
"Consider authentication system implementation approach with sequential-thinking. Consider OAuth2, JWT, and session management"

# Bug cause analysis
"Analyze memory leak causes with sequential-thinking. Include code review and profiling results"

# Refactoring strategy
cat src/complex_module.js
"Develop a refactoring strategy for this module with sequential-thinking"

# Technology selection
"Analyze frontend framework selection with sequential-thinking. Consider project requirements and constraints"
```

### Thinking Process

1. **Initial analysis** - Basic understanding and decomposition of the problem
2. **Hypothesis generation** - Establish hypotheses for solutions
3. **Verification and refinement** - Verify hypotheses and refine as needed
4. **Branching and exploration** - Explore multiple solution paths
5. **Integration and conclusion** - Derive optimal solutions

### Features

- **Dynamic adjustment** - Can change direction during thinking process
- **Hypothesis verification** - Cycle of hypothesis creation and verification
- **Branched thinking** - Simultaneous exploration of multiple thinking paths
- **Iterative refinement** - Progressive refinement of solutions
- **Flexibility** - Policy changes based on new information

### Detailed Examples

```bash
# Complex system design
"Consider e-commerce microservice design with sequential-thinking. Include order processing, inventory management, and payment integration"

# Security design
"Consider API security design with sequential-thinking. Include authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and audit logs"

# Performance optimization
"Consider large-scale data processing optimization with sequential-thinking. Consider memory usage, processing speed, and scalability"

# Dependency management
"Consider monorepo dependency management strategy with sequential-thinking. Include build time, deployment, and test execution"
```

### Important Notes

Sequential-thinking is optimal for complex problems requiring progressive deepening of thought. For simple questions or cases with clear answers, please use regular question format.

### Execution Examples

```bash
# Usage example
"Consider GraphQL schema design with sequential-thinking"

# Expected behavior
# 1. Initial analysis: Analyze GraphQL schema basic requirements
# 2. Hypothesis generation: Consider multiple design patterns
# 3. Verification: Verify pros and cons of each pattern
# 4. Branching: Explore new approaches as needed
# 5. Integration: Suggest optimal schema design
```
