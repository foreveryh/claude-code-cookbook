# Claude Code Cookbook

[English](README.md) | [ä¸­æ–‡](README_zh.md) | [æ—¥æœ¬èªž](README_ja.md) | [FranÃ§ais](README_fr.md) | [í•œêµ­ì–´](README_ko.md)

A configuration collection to make Claude Code more convenient to use.

By automating routine operations, you can focus on what really matters.
Claude Code intelligently handles common tasks like code modifications, test execution, and documentation updates.

## Key Features

Customize Claude Code's behavior through three dimensions:

- **Commands**: Custom commands starting with `/`
- **Roles**: Expert perspectives for specialized answers
- **Hooks**: Automatic script execution at specific timings

---

## Feature List

### Commands (Custom Commands)

Commands are stored as Markdown files in the `/commands` directory. Execute them by typing `/` followed by the filename.

### Roles (Role Settings)

Roles are defined in Markdown files in the `agents/roles/` directory. Give Claude expert perspectives for more accurate answers.

Each role can **run independently as a sub-agent**. Using the `--agent` option allows parallel execution of large-scale analysis or specialized processing without interfering with the main conversation context.

| Role | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `/role analyzer` | Act as a systems analysis expert to analyze code and architecture. |
| `/role architect` | Act as a software architect to provide design reviews and suggestions. |
| `/role frontend` | Act as a frontend expert to provide UI/UX and performance advice. |
| `/role mobile` | Act as a mobile app development expert, answering based on iOS/Android best practices. |
| `/role performance` | Act as a performance optimization expert to suggest speed and memory usage improvements. |
| `/role qa` | Act as a QA engineer to review from testing plans and quality assurance perspectives. |
| `/role reviewer` | Act as a code reviewer to evaluate code from readability and maintainability perspectives. |
| `/role security` | Act as a security expert to identify vulnerabilities and security risks. |

#### Sub-agent Execution Examples

```bash
# Regular mode (execute in main context)
/role security
"Check the security of this project"

# Sub-agent mode (execute in independent context)
/role security --agent
"Perform a security audit of the entire project"

# Multi-role parallel analysis
/multi-role security,performance --agent
"Comprehensively analyze system security and performance"
```

### Hooks (Automation Scripts)

Configure in `settings.json` to automate development workflows.

| Script | Event | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `deny-check.sh` | `PreToolUse` | Prevent execution of dangerous commands like `rm -rf /`. |
| `check-ai-commit.sh` | `PreToolUse` | Error if `git commit` message contains AI signature. |
| `preserve-file-permissions.sh` | `PreToolUse` / `PostToolUse` | Save original permissions before editing, restore after. Prevents Claude Code from changing permissions. |
| `ja-space-format.sh` | `PostToolUse` | Automatically format spaces between Japanese and alphanumeric characters when saving files. |
| `auto-comment.sh` | `PostToolUse` | Prompt to add docstrings or API documentation when creating new files or making major edits. |
| `notify-waiting` | `Notification` | Notify through macOS notification center when Claude is waiting for user confirmation. |
| `check-continue.sh` | `Stop` | Check for continuable tasks when a task completes. |
| `(osascript)` | `Stop` | Notify completion through macOS notification center when all tasks complete. |
