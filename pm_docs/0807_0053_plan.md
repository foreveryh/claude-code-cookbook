# Plan Log - 0807_0053

## Summary
Planning session for generating structured work logs and change logs according to the pm_docs template system. This session focuses on establishing proper documentation practices with standardized naming conventions and structured content formats.

## Work Process
1. **Analysis Phase**
   - Reviewed user requirements for pm_docs logging system
   - Identified need for three log types: plan, implementation, and documentation
   - Confirmed naming convention: MMDD_HHMM_*.md format
   - Analyzed template structure requirements from user rules

2. **Planning Phase**
   - Determined current timestamp: 0807_0053
   - Established pm_docs directory structure
   - Planned creation of template-compliant log files
   - Defined content structure for each log type

3. **Implementation Strategy**
   - Create pm_docs directory if not exists
   - Generate plan.md file with current session planning
   - Create impl.md template for implementation tracking
   - Create doc.md template for documentation work
   - Ensure all files follow MMDD_HHMM_*.md naming convention

## Results
- Established pm_docs directory structure
- Created standardized logging framework
- Implemented proper naming convention (0807_0053_*.md)
- Prepared templates for ongoing work documentation

## Next Steps
1. Generate implementation log (0807_0053_impl.md) for tracking development work
2. Generate documentation log (0807_0053_doc.md) for documentation activities
3. Validate all logs follow the required template structure
4. Begin using logs for actual work tracking and change documentation

## Notes
- All logs created following the structured template from user rules
- Timestamp format: MMDD_HHMM ensures chronological organization
- Template includes all required sections: Summary, Work Process, Results, Next Steps
- Notes section included for additional observations and challenges
